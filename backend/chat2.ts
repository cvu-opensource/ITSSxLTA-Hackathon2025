However, the data suggests that optimizing surface properties like occupancy and speed is crucial due to their direct impact on accident rates. Additionally, visibility improvements through construction and traffic hazard factors are less effective than others. While addressing these areas can prevent congestion, neglecting other variables may not fully address all safety concerns. Focusing on high-flow areas for proactive management could offer broader benefits without losing current efficiency in specific sectors.",

Driver Behavior: While surfaces can make roads safer, they don't account for how drivers behaveâ€”some may drive recklessly.\n\n2. Traffic Hazards: Even well-maintained roads lack awareness of potholes or weather conditions that can lead to accidents.\n\n3. Time-of-Day Adjustments: Accidents peak during rush hours, so systems must be timed accordingly.\n\n4. Smart Technology Implementation: Real-time data and adaptive systems are needed for effective driver control.\n\n5. Historical Data: Future issues may follow historical trends unless immediate action is taken.\n\nThe current approach misses these factors, leading to inefficiencies in safety despite surface improvements.",

To address this, we should consider integrating systems that account for driver behavior, such as real-time data to detect reckless driving.

Missing Critical Factors: The current approach ignores real-time driver behavior, traffic hazard awareness, and the impact of weather on safety. For example, potholes can form due to poor visibility caused by weather.\n2. Lack of Real-Time Data: Focusing only on surface improvements doesn't ensure timely detection of reckless driving or congestion, potentially leading to accidents before they occur.\n\nThis oversight indicates a need for a more comprehensive approach that integrates these elements.",

Key issues include missing dates (September 15th and September 30th), inconsistent numerical formats, and variability in accident counts that may not be clearly communicated. The absence of units for certain metrics could cause confusion.\n\nTo improve clarity:\n1. Standardize Units: Ensure all numeric values are in consistent units or ranges.\n2. Highlight Clarity: Use different colors for days with no accidents to emphasize safety focus.\n3. Confidence Intervals: Include these for better reliability assessment.\n4.
